AUR* packages I maintain

*AUR = Arch (Linux) User Repository


The file /watch executes the watch file in each
directory. This lists all packages that has been
updated upstream and each upstream that is not
reachable.

I run this automatically every half hour and my
RSS reader will notify me when there are packages
in need of update.
