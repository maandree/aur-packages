Subject: [PATCH xserver] present: Only requeue for next MSC after flip failure
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This code was added to deal with the driver present hook failing, in
which case we need to wait for the next MSC before executing the
presentation.

However, it could also take effect in cases where the driver incorrectly
thinks the current MSC matches the target one (e.g. due to the kernel
interface only supporting 32-bit MSC values), in which case it could
result in the presentation getting requeued over and over.

To prevent such issues, check specifically for the target MSC
immediately following the current MSC.
